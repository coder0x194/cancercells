# CancerCells
A simulation of cancer and cell division in keratinocytes, created as a biology project. Built with PhysicsJS.

-- This was a project done for a biology class where we simulated the division of normal and cancerous cells. The PhysicsJS library was 
used in order to show two cells drifting apart right after mitosis.
